Single-Cell Profiling Defines Transcriptomic Signatures Specific to Tumor-Reactive versus Virus-Responsive CD4+ T Cells
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31801070/
Tile is obvious about one of the 2 findings..
The analysis was thoroughly! explained. Glad I accidentally found this paper for scRNAseq analysis demonstration.

Perform scRNAseq on 3 experiments (each with 2 relicates): 
    1. solid tumor sample
    2. virus infected sample
    3. drainning lyph node (dLN) sample 
to study CD4+ T-cells':
    1.sub-celltype compositions
    2. gene expression patterns
and found:
    1. tumor infiltrating CD4+ T-cells are different than viral-responsive CD4+ T-cells
    2. tumor infiltrating CD4+ T-cells have variety among Th1-like cells, while
       dLN CD4+ T-cells have Tfh-like cells but lack Th1-like cells.

5 Steps in computational methods:
  Step1: Pre-processing
    1. CellRanger pre-processing & cell-calling
    2. Data cleaning: 
        remove (1) low-quality cells (with <500 genes), 
               (2) doublets (since the cell-type resolution here is high, better remove doubles, even cells have already been sorted/purified during experiment)
               (3) senescent cells (this I didn't know we need to remove, probably same rationale as removing dead cells)
    3. Normalization remove sequencing depth effect)
    4. log-transformation

   Step2: Dimensionality Reduction (For visualization)
     1. [Define highly variable genes]
        [PCA]
     2. Select PCs with permutation test (PCs that can separate highly vs non-highly variable genes)
     3. Tsne on selected PCs

   Step3: Clustering (Phenograph, graph based clustering method which is based on KNN)
     1. Parameter tuning to find the best #clusters on each of the 6 (3 samples x 2 replicates) datasets 
        (P.s., measurement is based on ratio of intra-cluster compactness & inter-cluster separation)
     2. Filter out B cells (This might be because B cells and T cells they attach with each other when immune responses happen and hence hard to sort them out during experiment)
     3. Back to Step 2, redo everything (Because PCA has to be redone and hence updates PCs, etc...)

   Step4: Differential Gene Expression Analysis (Within each dataset, unless datasets have to be merged due to quality concern)
     1. DE pick out genes on each cluster (one cluster vs the rest within dataset comparison)
     2. Get FC fold change for each cluster
     3. Pearson correlation of FC cross datasets

   Step5: Robust Clustering Calling & Robust Population Comparison 
     1. Hierarchical clustering (on clusters inferred above)
     2. meta-clusters (Because clusters does not equal to cell-type, sometimes(of course depends on research interest) can be collapsed.)
     3. [Find special genes in the meta-clusters defined before]: 
        [Results consistent cross duplicates?] 
        [organ/Tissue specific gene-expressions?] in meta-clusters  --> Back to findings 
        [tumor/virus specific gene expressions?] in meta-clusters  --> Back to findings 



From time to time I realize in hindsight how wide a time span covers learning a very simple concept for me......
T-cells: CD8+ Tcells (related to MHC-I mainly kill cells)
         CD4+ Tcells (related to MHC-II, mainly help B cells, also help CD8+ Tcells, and macrophages etc.. it helps a lot...)
