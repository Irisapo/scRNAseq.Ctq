my 2cents: 
Although the #non-empty droplets estimated by EmptyDrops is pretty close to cellRanger (tested on a 4k PBMCs from 10x Genomics by myself, 
dataset: https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/2.1.0/pbmc4k), the overlap of this method and cellRanger
differs greatly. Setting seed at 12345, (1) about 8.5% of the droplets estimated as non-empty by cellRanger are estimated to be empty by EmptyDrops; 
also (2) about the same proportion of the droplets estiamted as non-empty by EmptyDrops are estimated to be empty by cellRanger. 
However, EmptyDrops have an additional functionality, adding a threshold of the UMIs for estimating empty droplets. This will 
eliminate discrepency in (1), but (maybe) potentially worse (2) (have not tested out yet). 

Just to look at the method itself: there potentially can be a very bad estimation when applying EmptyDrops on a scRNA-seq data where
only one cell population is profiled (flow cytomery sorted cells then profiled). This is the drawback of the method itself, even though the
method per se is reasonable. Getting a empirical distribution from whatever that comes from the one cell population scRNA-seq data, 
the empirical multinomial distribution is sure to resemble the cell's actual expression. So the likelihood (of being empty) proposed 
by the author of a non-empty droplet would still be super high, leading to high false positive.  (have not tested this out yet... should do)
