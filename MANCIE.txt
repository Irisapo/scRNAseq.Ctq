Interstingly, to correct batch effect (platform etc.) or to integrate two types of (similar) data, 
the correction is measured within each row based on that row's reference in the 2nd matrix (associated matrix).
The correlation is used to make adjustment: 
	correlation too small <--> smaller than the cutoff value, keep the original value
	correlation too large <--> use PCA 1st component of the matrix composed of these two rows
	correlation in between <--> adjust the original value by the associated value in percentage (represented by correlation)

Adjusted results is not making any trememdous change, both in a good and bad way.
(Making the very significant results more significant.)

This method might be a good start for something really useful.
Simple enough to be built on.

Notes: 
	1.which one do you need to adjust? of the two matrices, which one should be reference or the adjusted?
	  Since the adjustment is not symmetric.
	2.correlation is not a good choice to measure concordance in some situations
	  Especially when the data is compliated in a mysterious way... (Sparcity etc.) 
	3. Since it is using only row (feature) information
	  Normalization cross samples is going to make huge impact on the adjustment
