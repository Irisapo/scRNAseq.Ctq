This tool(method) is to find the relative progression process of each individual along a biological process.
Protocal/datatype: apply to a wide range of datasets, useful for any scRNA-seq protocal; can also be applyed on bulk RNA-seq data. Even though the paper does not specifically point out that this method can also be used on non-RNA seq data, it should be (at leastest methodologically speaking).

What I like about this method: conceptually simple. At its simplest, it is a Bayesian linear regression with interactions. That is, covariate-pseudotime
interaction linear model. Covariates are phenotypic or environmental variables, revealing (biological) context of the data. Pseudotime is the latent variable 
the model has to estimate, repsenting the relative progression process of each individual. The interaction is claimed to the novelty of this linear model, 
saying that the (pseudo)time which can be affected by the covariates can cause the objects to evolve differently over (pseudo)time (which I have no doublt about).
 
This method would aid finding interesting biological problems by not complicating the analysis process in a way that Bayesian approach make constraint when 
there is not much to support that analyst's assumption and let the data itself to speak when necessary (by setting a weak/noninformative prior). 



(Need to test it out by June 2019)
