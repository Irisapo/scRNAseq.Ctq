why RNA velocity should be expected to help analysis of cell development lineages???

1. RNA velocity is just the first derivative of gene expression (in the ideal case. And I think there might be other reasons that contribute to RNA velocity, cell cycle etc.) 
2. Development lineage's association with Gene expression does not promise its association with its derivative (RNA velocity). For example: 
		(a) To simply put it, that I run faster does not mean this is a particular pattern of my acceleration. It can be constant, can be increasing/decrasing, and arbitrary... 
		(b) Think about a restaurant at lunch time, the service a staff provides can be analogous to gene expression (as they both are only to fullfill an activity's requirement:
						customers' dining needs in the restaurant, and cells' needs in the gene expression) 
						The change (can be positive or negative) of the amount of work per minute for this staff resembles RNA velocity.
								It's reasonable to think that a staff has a havier work load when there are more customers,
								but it is unnatural to think the staff's work load **change** is directly linked to his/her work load...   
						This work load change is mostly dominantedly affected by the speed of the change of the custmers numbers, which itself 
						is affected by so many other reasons that have nothing to do with this staff.. 
						(i.e., a variable x's derivatives really does not have to have any particular pattern associated with the pattern of x itself, it can though, it does not have to...)
